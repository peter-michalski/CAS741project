as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.

\section{Introduction}

Lattice Boltzmann Methods are a family of fluid dynamics algorithms for simulating single-phase and multiphase fluid flows, often incorporating additional physical complexities. \citet{chen1998lattice}. These methods consider the behavious of a collection of particles as a single "unit" at the mesoscopic scale. on probability of particles rather than mapping every particle (miscoscopic scale - Hamilton's equation) which is heavy on data or the Navier -strokes method (macroscopic) which is difficult ot solve analyticlaly. ... very efficient...growing in popularity..
Lattice Boltzmann methods are a modern approach to computational fluid dynamics and close the gap betweeen the micro and macro scale. 


\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This document will outline 

\subsection{Scope of the Family} 

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} 

\subsection{Organization of Document}

\section{General System Description}

This section identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment,
describes the potential user characteristics and lists the potential system
constraints.

\subsection{Potential System Contexts}

\plt{Your system context will likely include an explicit list of user and system
  responsibilities}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item \famname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
  floating point number
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The end user of \famname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level
1 Calculus and Physics.

\subsection{Potential System Constraints}

SC - The system will use a lattice structure to map the fluid flow

\plt{You may not have any system constraints.}

\plt{If you need to make design decisions for your family, these decisions will
  be made here as constraints.  For instance, if all inputs will have to use the
same file format, this would be a constraint that would be included here.}

\plt{You should generally limit the number of constraints, to keep the CA
  abstract.}

\section{Commonalities}

\subsection{Background Overview} \label{Sec_Background}

There are two steps...

The particles are mapped using a lattice structure. The lattice structure can be a !D, 2D, or 3D model with varying velocity directions. The notatin is DXQY, where X epresends the number of dimensions and Y represents the number of velociy directions. The lattice models are vast and standardized, but the individual solvers within the family may only use a subset of them. The LBM uses the distribution funciton to predict which direction of the specified model a group of particles will travel.

Sum of the weight coefficients is 1. 

Particles bounce back when they encounter a boundary.

\subsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\subsection{Data Definitions} \label{sec_datadef}

models. The dimension of each quantity is also given.  \plt{Modify the examples

\subsection{Goal Statements}

\noindent Given the boundary conditions, lattice model, weighting coefficient of the lattice, simulation time, fluid particle mass, and initial conditions for the momentum, density and position of the fluid particles, as well as any applied external force, the goal statements are:

The Lattice-Boltzmann Methods compute velocity and pressure as momentum of the distribution functions.

The Lattice-Boltzmann Methods rely on a two step process for computing fluid dynamics. The first processes is streaming (define more). The methods consider particles at each grid point, moving to an adjacent grid point at its velocity.
The second process is accounting for collision (define).
The methods can be applied to a variety of computational fluid dynamics problems, and rely on further derivations of the above theoretical models in order to be applicable to various fluid dynamics scopes.

\plt{In a CA, the TMs often do not need to be refined.  However, this is not a
  rule.  In some cases, it may make sense to introduce an IM, or possibly even a
  GD in between the TM and the IM.}

\section{Variabilities}
state the binding time for each of the variabilities

input variabilities? what are their associated parameters of variation?  see table lecture 5 slide 39/40

\end{table}




\plt{The variabilities are summarized in the following subsections.  They may
  each be summarized separately, like in \citet{SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}, or
  in a table, as in \citet{Smith2006}.}

\plt{For each variability, a description should be given, along with the
  parameters of variation and the binding time.  The parameters of variation
  give the type that defines possible values.  The binding time is when the
  variability is set.  The possible values are specification time (scope time),
  build time and run time.}

\subsection{Assumptions}
also see slide 47 


\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_flowObject}:]
  The fluid can, but does not need to, flow through an object with boundary conditions.
  
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_lattice}:]
  The fluid flows through space via a lattice structure, moving between lattice nodes via linkages $Q$.
  
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_visualPresentation}:]
  There is a visual presentation of the predicted fluid flow available in all libraries.
  
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_dataPassed}:]
  Data representing the predicted fluid flow can be passed externally of the system through memory or a file.  
  
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_weightCoefficients}:]
  Weight coefficients are standard for each lattice model. See the Appendix section for weight coefficients for a subset of lattice models.

\plt{The calculation variabilities should be as abstract as possible.  If there
  are variabilities that are related to imposed design decisions, the system
  constraints section should be referenced for the relevant constraint.  Design
  constraint related variabilities should be listed separately.}

\plt{Variabilities related to data structure choices would go in this section.
  However, these variabilities are related to design, so they should be
  separated from the more abstract variabilities.}

\plt{Algorithmic variations would go here as well, but as for data structures,
  they should be separated from the more abstract variabilities.}

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Family of Functional Requirements}

\plt{Since the CA will often be applied to a library, the functionality will not
  be a single use case.  Therefore, this section should summarize the family of
  potential requirements.  A good way to provide an overview of the functional
  requirements would be to provide multiple use cases on how the library will be
  employed.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] \plt{Requirements
    for the inputs that are supplied by the user.  This information has to be
    explicit.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputInputs}:] \plt{It isn't
    always required, but often echoing the inputs as part of the output is a
    good idea.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] \plt{Calculation
    related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_VerifyOutput}:]
  \plt{Verification related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] \plt{Output related
    requirements.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

rather than absolute quantification of nfrs, use relative comparison between other program family members

specify requirements in big O notation

NFR -> AHP 

relative comparison between programs is a validateable requirement

focus on a posteriori description rather than a priori specification

identify benchmark test problems

test cases built starting from assumed solutions

see slide 42

ahp each design against each nfr see slide 42



\plt{To allow the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) to vary between family
  members, try to parameterize them.  The value of the parameter is than a variability.}

\plt{An important variability between family members it the relative importance
  of the NFRs.  \citet{Smith2006} shows how pairwise comparisons can be used to
  rank the importance of NFRs.}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
  criterion to make them verifiable.}

Correctness - satisfies reqs spec
Reliability - usually does what it is intnded to do
Robustness - behaves reasnably during exceptional situations
Performance (low computer resource usage): evaluated using empirical measurement, analysis of an analytic model, or analysis of a simulation model
Usability - ease of usage, user interface,installability?
maintainability - ease of modification; corrective, adaptive, perfective
Reusability - create a new product? standardized? instantiable components?
Portability - run in different environments? hardware platform, operating system, supporting software, user base

understandability - ease with which the reqs, design, implementation, documentation, etc can be understood -> impacts verifiability, maintainability, resusablity

Define these in the document before using them.



\section{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{If
    there is a ranking of variabilities, or combinations of variabilities, that
    are more likely, this information can be included here.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

\plt{You will have to add tables.}

\section{Appendix}

\plt{Your report may require an appendix.  For instance, this is a good point to
show the values of the symbolic parameters introduced in the report.}

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

\plt{The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
  reference by fields as automatically generatable
\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your
  requirement could be more abstract
\item For families the notion of binding time should be introduced
\item Think of families as a library, not as a single program
\end{itemize}
