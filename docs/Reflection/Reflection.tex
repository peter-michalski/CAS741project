\maketitle

This document is a reflection of the development of {\myprogname}, which provides services based on Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LBM).

\section{Project Overview}

The goal of {\myprogname} is to predict changes in fluid characteristics such as location, velocity and pressure over time using LBM.\\

\noindent The functional requirements of {\myprogname} can be found in Section \ref{ext1-CAFRS} of the Commonality Analysis (\citet{LBM_CA_PM}). The non-functional requirements can be found in Section \ref{ext1-CANFRS} of that document.


\section{Key Accomplishments}

The templates and language of the documentation allowed for good traceability. Referencing the documentation was straightforward, as was updating it.\\

\noindent The Module Guide (\citet{LBM_MG_PM}) and Module Implementation Specification (\citet{LBM_MIS_PM}) allowed for quick and easy development of {\myprogname}.\\

\noindent The design process was very helpful in managing the development of {\myprogname}.

\section{Key Problem Areas}

\noindent The scope of {\myprogname} was too large to complete in the original time-frame, which needed to be extended. Only one library problem could be developed and tested in the first stage of implementation.

\section{What Would you Do Differently Next Time}

\noindent As the scope of the project was too broad, I would consider reducing it if I were to attempt to complete it in the current time-frame. Alternatively, if the time-frame were extended, I would increase the time  between deliverables.
