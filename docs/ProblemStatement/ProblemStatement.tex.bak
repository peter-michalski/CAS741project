\section{Problem}
The Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) are a powerful technique to simulate multiphase and multicomponent fluid dynamics using a mesoscopic distribution function. The LBM have grown in popularity since its inception and there are now several open-source implementations of LBM for simulating fluid dynamics over a range of parameters. These implementations are of varying complexity and they offer many distinct parameter options, which can be challenging for the user.
   
\section{Solution}
This project will conduct a commonality analysis for the aforementioned family of LBM solvers, and will attempt to distinguish key solver functionality. A new solver will be built that will include the most important features found in the commonality analysis, providing the user with a basic, easy to use, implementation of LBM.

\section{Context}
\subsection{Environment}
The solver will be compatible with KDE neon 5.16 (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) and macOS 10.13.6. Compatibility with other operating systems will not be guaranteed.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
Stakeholders include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dr. Spencer Smith
\item Dr. Jacques Carette
\item Ao Dong
\item Other members of my M.Eng project team
\item Individuals studying or working with Lattice Boltzmann implementations
\end{itemize}
